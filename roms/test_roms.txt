These are simple test ROMs that can be used to verify or debug various emulator functionality.

hello-world.gb
    Displays a fancy Hello World graphic to the screen.
    Does not halt or use interrupts. Simply waits until first VBlank period, copies tile and tile map data,
    then enters an infinite loop.

window.gb
    Simple window test that uses the LCDC Mode 00 (HBlank) interrupt to enable and disable the window at
    different Y lines. End result is that the first 20 lines of the window are displayed 10 at the top of
    the screen and 10 at the bottom of the screen.
    After copying tile and tile map data, enables LCDC Mode 00 interupts and then halts. On every HBlank,
    checks LY to see whether to enable or disable the window by using the LCDC window flag.

controller.gb
    Reads controller input every VBlank and updates corresponding tiles on the screen to indicate which
    buttons are being pressed.
